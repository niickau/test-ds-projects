# Data-Science-Projects
In this repository some of my train-projects I've done:

- **Churn_Prediction** (the final project of Coursera Specialization - the problem of binary classification, whether the client is prone to churn or not)
- **Segmentation** (the decicision of Kaggle competition - Carvana Image Masking Challenge)
- **Denoising_Autoencoder** (part of my pix2pix GAN for image colorization)
